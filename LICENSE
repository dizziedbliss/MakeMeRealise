# Make Me Realize There's No Need for a License

Hey there! So you want a license for your "Make Me Realize" project? Let me make you realize something about licenses...

You know how people say "sharing is caring"? Well, that's exactly what this project is about. You're free to use this code, modify it, share it, and even host it yourself. It's like that cookie jar at grandma's house – take some, but don't be that person who empties the whole jar and tries to sell cookies on the street corner.

And speaking of selling – seriously? You're thinking about monetizing a project that's meant to make people realize their impact on the world? That's like charging people to tell them they're wasting water. The irony would be delicious if it wasn't so sad.

So here's the deal: this project is free. Like "free as a bird" free, not "free trial that asks for your credit card" free. Use it, share it, improve it, but keep it free. Because if you try to sell it, well... I'll have to make you realize how karma works. 

By using this project, you're basically pinky-promising to be cool about it. Don't be that person who ruins it for everyone else. We're trying to make the world better here, not fund someone's next yacht.

## TL;DR - The "No License" License
• Free to use and share
• No commercial use
• Keep it open and accessible
• Be cool, don't be greedy
• Make the world better, not richer

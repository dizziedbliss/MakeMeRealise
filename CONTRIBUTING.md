## Why Would Anyone Want to Contribute?

Oh, you want to contribute? *gasp* How dare you try to make this project better! But since you insist on being helpful (the audacity!), here's what you need to know...

First off, we absolutely hate it when people come along and fix our typos, improve our documentation, or add cool new features. It's just so... considerate? Ugh. And don't even get us started on those people who report bugs. Like, why would you want to help us make the project more stable?

But fine, if you're going to be one of those amazingly supportive community members who just can't help themselves from making positive contributions, you might as well read on.

## Contributing

So you want to make this project even more awesome? That's the spirit! Just like how we're making people realize things about their impact, you can help us realize ways to improve this project. Whether you spot a typo, have a brilliant idea, or just want to make things better – we're all ears.

Remember though, this is about making positive change, not showing off your elite coding skills (although we won't complain if you do both). Keep your contributions aligned with our goal: making people realize things in the most effective way possible.

And hey, before you dive deep into refactoring everything – open an issue first. Let's have a chat about your ideas. After all, realizations often come through conversations, right?

### Some Ground Rules

- Keep it simple and impactful – like those moments when reality hits you
- Your code should be as clear as the realizations we're trying to create
- Test your changes – we don't want false realizations, do we?
- Be respectful in discussions – sometimes the best realizations come from listening
